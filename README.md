The main driver for signing up to Makers was my desire to change careers. I chose coding because I enjoy problem solving and learning new things. Those two, coupled with the challenging nature of coding made it an appealing option

## Hobbies

- I enjoy playing basketball and when I go on vacation, some basketball has to be involved! It is a real passion of mine and I love the team work and competitiveness, even when I lose it motivates me to learn and improve so we win next time.
- Learning Romanian. Slowly but surely I am working my way through the ranks of Duolingo to improve my Romanian. I want to be able to order food and drinks during my holidays.
- I like to keep active, so during lockdown I rediscovered my love of mountain biking. The first time I got back on a bike after many years all the good memories I had of riding through beautiful bike trails with friends came flooding back.

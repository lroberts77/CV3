E-commerce manager turned software Developer, I am a recent graduate of Makers Academy May 2020. Inquisitive to all things tech and music, I pride myself in attention to detail, problem solving and learning new things to enable me to help others. I'm looking forward to building a career in Software Development, where I can use the skills I have acquired and learn new skills.

## Skills

#### Efficient and economical
I consciously try to be as efficient as possible, which sometimes conflicts with my need to make sure everything is as perfect as possible. But I have learned to strike a good balance between the two. My last role has taught me a lot about working under pressure, working methodically to solve problems and communication which I have used to help me to become a better software developer.

#### Communication and teamwork
During my time at Makers, I was tasked with programming in pairs or teams nearly every day of the course. Communication is crucial to continuous learning as well as being able to summarise problems to find efficient solutions. I am confident in explaining technological concepts with metaphors and non-technical language in order to make it as accessible as possible.

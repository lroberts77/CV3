The main driver for signing up to Makers was my desire to change careers. I chose coding because I enjoy problem solving and learning new things. Those two, coupled with the challenging nature of coding made it an appealing option

E-commerce manager turned software Developer, I am a recent graduate of Makers Academy May 2020. Inquisitive to all things tech and music, I pride myself in attention to detail and my desire to explore new technologies. I strive to build a career in Software Development, where I am challenged daily with strategical thinking at the forefront of the evolving technological world.

## Skills

#### Efficient and economical
I consciously try to be as efficient as possible, which sometimes conflicts with my need to make sure everything is as perfect as possible. But I have learned to strike a good balance between the two. My last two roles have taught me a lot about working under pressure, working methodically to solve problems and communication which I have used to help me to 

#### Communication and teamwork
During my time at Makers, I was tasked with programming in pairs or teams nearly every day of the course. Communication is crucial to continuous learning as well as being able to summarise problems to find efficient solutions. I am confident in explaining technological concepts with metaphors and non-technical language in order to make it as accessible as possible.

## Hobbies

- I enjoy playing basketball and when I go on vacation, some basketball has to be involved! It is a real passion of mine and I love the team work and competitiveness, even when I lose it motivates me to learn and improve so we win next time.
